    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      Data driven approaches in the realm of basketball to improve team performance are not centralized or standardized. With the use of short charts and heat maps, teams can better understand their chemistry, efficiency and productivity. The visualizations provided show overlapping heat maps where certain players perform better than others. To better structure your team with the nuance of data, coaches and staff can utilize the visualizations to know what players perform better with certain teammates, against certain players/teams, in particular quarters of the game.

  <h1>Demo Video</h1>
  
  <p>
    Embed an MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, below is a screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3. <strong>Be sure to delete this filler text before your final submission!</strong>

    <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
     a <a href='http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4'>link to the video</a> instead.</p>

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
  <p>
    Current visualization explanation: The scatter plot shows EFG% (umbrella stat that tells how effective a team is) versus the teams wins. Here we can see data that is positively correlated which will tell our end users a sector to improve on. In the bargraph we simply have the wins each team had in the season, once brushing and linking is created, teams can easily see how wins and effective field goal percentage (EFG) are correlated.
