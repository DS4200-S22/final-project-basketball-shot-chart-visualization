    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      Data driven approaches in the realm of basketball to improve team performance are not centralized or standardized. With the use of scatter plots, bar graphs and linking, teams can better understand their chemistry, efficiency and productivity. The visualizations provided show data per NBA team to showcase their strengths and weaknesses. To better structure your team with the nuance of data, coaches and staff can utilize the visualizations to know where they stack up against other teams, which teams to look out for and the biggest/most important areas that need improvement.

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
  <p>
    In the first section, there is the League Outlook sector. In here the user can brush over the scatter plots showcasing Wins versus Effective Field Goal Percentage or 3 point field goal percentage versus three point attempts. 
    When the brushing is done, the bar graph in the middle showcasing each team's total win will also be bolded based on the data bolded in either of the scatter plots. Hovering over any bar graph in the middle bar graph within League Outlook,
    will showcase that team's name, wins, EFG%, 3 pointer percentage and attempted 3 pointers. Furthermore, the linking can also be seen below, as those same teams will be bolded in all three of the bar graphs in the middle section: Shooting
    Percentages By Team. This section showcases field goal percentage by team, free throw percentage by team and three point field goal percentage by team. All of these bars can be hovered over, where they will then showcase the team's name
    and the three statistics just mentioned. Lastly, in the Average Statistics For Teams That Made and Missed Playoffs, the average statistics for EFG%, 3 point field goal percentage, wins, field goal percentage and free throw percentage can all
    be seen in this sector. Hovering over any bar gives the user the exact value of the bar they are hovering over. Using all of this data together, team's know where they must improve upon and they will also see how other teams succeed. This helps
    team's and manangers make executive choices to better themselves for the following season.
